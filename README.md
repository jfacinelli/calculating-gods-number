# Calculating Gods Number Using Spectral Graph Theory
A final project on calculating God's number of a Rubik's cube using spectral graph theory

The project is done using Maple to generate the Rubik's cube group, Cayley graphs, and adjacency matrices.  Then using Matlab to calculate the eigenvalues of the graphs to determine information about the cube.

Our final paper is also attached, it was written using LaTeX on Overleaf, the files for the paper attached as well.
